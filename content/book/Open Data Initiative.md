## A groundbreaking partnership with a new vision for renewable data and intelligent applications

Digital transformation is how you compete and win today. It’s the path to better serve customers, build better products, and empower employees. And it's data that is the foundational resource that allows you to transform and uncover the insights you need to drive business forward.

Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP are partnering on the Open Data Initiative to enable data to be exchanged—and enriched—across systems, making it a renewable resource that flows into intelligent applications.

With a single, comprehensive view of data, you’ll discover in real-time more about your customers, identify ways to maximize operations, and find new ways to provide the amazing experiences that your customers deserve.

* Unified: A single view of data built on one data model
* Intelligent: Artificial intelligence driven insights
* Extensible: An open and extensible platform
